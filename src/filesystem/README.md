# std::filesystem Demo
Demo of `std::filesystem` feature, implementing a few features from Python's `os` module. `std::filesystem` provides an improved way to navigate the files and directories of the computer that the corresponding code is run on. 

# File list:
- filesystem.cpp: C++ impelementation of some of Python's `os` module features. 

# Makefile
- `make exe` builds executable binaries.

# Notes
- The features implemented in filesystem.cpp are `os.getcwd()`, `os.listdir()`, and `os.path.isdir()`.
